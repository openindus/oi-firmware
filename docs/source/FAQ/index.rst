My device is not detected by my computer
****************************************

This is a common issue, in most case it is because Windows fails to automatically install the driver. Download it from `Silicon Labs website <https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>`_. Go to the *"Download"* section and choose the driver adapted to your computer configuration.

If the problem is not solved after a successful driver installation, check if your device is detected when you use an other USB cable.


I have a space in my ".platformio" directory or in my project directory
