OI-Discrete
===========

Description
-----------

The OI-Discrete module is a versatile input/output (I/O) module designed to facilitate digital signal processing within various industrial applications. 

**Key Features:**

* Digital Inputs: The module provides 10 digital input channels, facilitating the connection of external sensors, switches, or other digital devices.
* Digital Outputs: With 8 digital output channels, the module enables control of external devices or actuators through digital signals.
* Analog Inputs: Additionally, the module includes 2 analog input channels, allowing for the processing of continuous voltage. 
  These analog inputs are not suitable for reading low-impedance sensors but are convenient for reading power supply voltage or conditioned analog signals.

**Compact Design:**
The module comes in a compact BOI12 package, saving space in control cabinets. 
It's easy to install, with up to four modules fitting on a single rail. 
This scalability makes it simple to expand the system based on specific needs.

.. note::
  The OI-Discrete module functions either as a standalone unit (with user code injected directly) or as a slave unit (with user code executed on a Master module, 
  receiving commands via the communication bus).

Pinout
