RS232/485 Half Duplex
=====================

Description
-----------

This feature, present ton :ref:`OI-Core<OI-Core>`/:ref:`OI-CoreLite<OI-CoreLite>` allow you to use two different protocol on same physical interface: RS485 half duplex or RS232.

There is no terminaison resistance. If you use RS485 bus and place the module at end of line you will need to add a 120Ohms resistance.
