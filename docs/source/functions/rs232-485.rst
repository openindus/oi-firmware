RS232/485 Half Duplex
=====================

Description
-----------

This feature, present ton :ref:`OI-Core<OI-Core>`/:ref:`OI-CoreLite<OI-CoreLite>` allow you to use two different protocol on same physical interface: RS485 half duplex or RS232.

There is no terminaison resistance. If you use RS485 bus and place the module at end of line you will need to add a 120Ohms resistance.

Code examples
-------------

The example code above demonstrates how to use RS485 on :ref:`OI-Core<OI-Core>`/:ref:`OI-CoreLite<OI-CoreLite>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/RS485.cpp
    :language: cpp

To use RS232 instead of RS485, just change the mode in the begin function:

.. code-block:: cpp

    core.rs.begin(9600, RS::Config::_8N1, RS::Mode::RS232);
