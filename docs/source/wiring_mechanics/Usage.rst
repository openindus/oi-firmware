It is a 16 contacts board connector with a pitch of 3.5mm. 
It support wire cross section from 0.2mm² up to 1.5mm².

.. warning:: 
    Do not use wire ferrules with these terminal blocks. 
    Ferrules with insulating collar do not fit properly in the connector, and ferrules without insulating collar get stuck inside the terminal mechanism. 
    The terminal blocks are designed for bare wire connections only.

Wiring steps:

1. Strip the wire insulation over a length of 7 to 8 mm.
2. Press the spring of the terminal block using a flat-head screwdriver, then insert the stripped wire until it is securely held.

Make sure no copper strands are exposed outside the terminal block and that the wire is firmly held.

2. How to put modules on rails
